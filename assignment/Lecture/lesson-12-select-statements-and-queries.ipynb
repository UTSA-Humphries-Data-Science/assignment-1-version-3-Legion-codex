    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Database Exploration\n",
    "- How to list all tables in a database\n",
    "- How to examine table structure (columns, data types)\n",
    "- How to peek at sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ SELECT Statements\n",
    "- Basic SELECT syntax: `SELECT columns FROM table`\n",
    "- Selecting specific columns vs `SELECT *`\n",
    "- Using LIMIT to control result size\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Filtering Data\n",
    "- WHERE clause for filtering rows\n",
    "- Comparison operators (=, >, <, etc.)\n",
    "- Combining conditions with AND/OR\n",
    "- Pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards (%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Sorting Results\n",
    "- ORDER BY clause\n",
    "- Ascending (ASC) vs Descending (DESC)\n",
    "- Sorting by multiple columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Joining Tables\n",
    "- Why we need JOINs in relational databases\n",
    "- INNER JOIN - matching rows only\n",
    "- LEFT JOIN - all rows from left table\n",
    "- Multiple JOINs - combining 3+ tables\n",
    "- Table aliases for cleaner queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✓ Aggregate Functions\n",
    "- COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM()\n",
    "- GROUP BY for grouping results\n",
    "- HAVING for filtering groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always explore before querying** - understand table structure first\n",
    "2. **Start simple, build complexity** - test queries incrementally\n",
    "3. **Use aliases** - make queries readable (e = employees, d = departments)\n",
    "4. **JOINs are essential** - most real queries combine multiple tables\n",
    "5. **WHERE vs HAVING** - WHERE filters rows, HAVING filters groups\n",
    "6. **Test with LIMIT** - when exploring large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice writing more complex JOINs\n",
    "- Learn about subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)\n",
    "- Explore window functions for advanced analytics\n",
    "- Study query optimization and indexes"
